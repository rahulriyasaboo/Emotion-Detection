# Emotion-Detection
# Overview
This project focuses on building a real-time emotion detection system using OpenCV and deep learning. The system captures video from a webcam, detects faces, and classifies emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and neutrality. It leverages pre-trained deep learning models to analyze facial expressions and provide real-time feedback.
# Key Features:
- Real-time Face Detection using OpenCV.
- Emotion Classification with a deep learning model (e.g., FER-2013 dataset).
- Live Webcam Processing to analyze facial expressions dynamically.
- Overlay Detected Emotions on the user’s face.
- Optimized Performance using multi-threading for real-time inference.
# Technologies Used
